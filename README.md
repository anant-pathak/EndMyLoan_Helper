# EndMyLoan_Helper
No it won't help you pay but helps project when your loan will end. Isn't that sweet to imagine :P 

### Have info of the following: 
1) Total loan amount left. 
2) Interest / year. (It'd automatically convert it into %/month)
3) Total number of months left for the loan to get repaid. 
4) Extra monthly payment you wish to make apart from paying the interest amount due every month(which would get calculated automatically). 

It'd list for each month the following: 

**Monthly(Extra payment being made) | 	ACH(Interest amount payment) | 	Left amount**

## How to run the script? 

In terminal: 
> g++ EMI_Calc.cpp <br />
> ./a.out
